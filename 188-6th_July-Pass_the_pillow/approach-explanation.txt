similiar to solve 3178. Find the Child Who Has the Ball After K Seconds

Approach
Modular arithmetic with period N=2*(n-1)

Modular arithmetic x=time%N
The answer is 1+((x<n)?x:N-x)
Let us consider the small integer, say n=5
 1  2  3  4  5
 9  8  7  6
   10 11 12 13
17 16 15 14
N=2Ã—5-2=8, when x>=n, x=time mod N one has to do N-x. Don't forget plus 1.
