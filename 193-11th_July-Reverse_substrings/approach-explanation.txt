Intuition
1st try is just to obtain an acceptible code by simulation.

Use std::string stack as a stack; the behavior of pop_back for chars is just reversing the chars.

This solution is in no way optimal; later try other approach.

LC has shown the so-called Wormhole solution which is in fact by @lee several years ago; a different version with the idea Wormholes is also done.

Approach
Need 2 strings, stack as a stack for chars & rev which reverses the desired substring
Transverse the whole string s
When c is not ')' add it to stack
Otherwise proceed the following process
rev="";
char r=stack.back();
for(; r!='('; r=stack.back()){//reversing substring
   rev+=r;
   stack.pop_back();
}
stack.pop_back();// removing '('
stack+=rev;
stack is the answer

Complexity
Time complexity: O(n^2)
Wormholes: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
