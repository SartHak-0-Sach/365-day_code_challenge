Intuition
We have to check whether the current element in the current array is also present in the other array that has been given to us, What data structure can we use here?

Approach
We simply store one array in a map with all its frequencies, and while iterating the other given array if we encounter the current element of the current array in the map with suitable frequency we will add that element to our answer vector. Also remember that we have to delete any element that has 0 frequncy to avoid adding extra elements to our answer vector.

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n+m) Iterating over the vectors and finding the element in tree map.

Space complexity:
O(n) An answer vector to return and a map to store elements.
