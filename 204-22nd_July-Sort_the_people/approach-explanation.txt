Intuition
Since we need to sort the names based on decreasing number of their respective heights, we need to sort the heights.

Approach
Push the pair of heights and names on to the heap.
Get the names from the heap which will be in the decreasing order of the heights and store them in names vector
Complexity
Time complexity:
O(nlog(n))
Space complexity:
