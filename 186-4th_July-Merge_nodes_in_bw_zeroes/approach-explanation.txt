Intuition
This function processes a linked list where segments between consecutive zeroes are summed into new nodes. It starts iterating from the second node (head->next) to skip the initial zero. As it traverses, it accumulates values (c) until it encounters a zero, then creates a new node with the accumulated sum. The resulting linked list consists of these summed nodes, effectively merging segments of nodes between zeroes into single nodes with their aggregated values.

Approach
Initialization:
temp starts at head->next to skip the initial zero.
ans is a new dummy node to construct the result list.
tempAns points to the dummy node, used to build the result list.
c is a counter to sum the values between zeroes.
Traversal and Summation:
Traverse the linked list using temp.
If temp is not zero, add its value to c.
If temp is zero, create a new node with the value c and add it to the result list. Then, reset c to zero.
Construction of the Result List:
For each segment of values between zeroes, create a new node and link it to the result list.
Continue this until the end of the original list.
The result list is built starting from ans->next to skip the dummy node.
