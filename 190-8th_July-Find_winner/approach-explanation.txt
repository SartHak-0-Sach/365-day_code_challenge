Consider the Math problem with ref in wiki
Josephus problem

This problem can be solved with simulation, but it is basically a Math problem. It needs to study for a while.

A simulation C++ using queue is also presented.

Approach
Let f(n,k) denote the position of the survivor.
The wiki says:

The position of the survivor in the remaining circle would be f(n−1,k) if counting is started at 1; shifting this to account for the fact that the starting point is (kmodn)+1 yields the recurrence f(n,k)=((f(n−1,k)+k−1)modn)+1, with f(1,k)=1

Use it & done.

I would not say such problems would be easy. The hardest part is to find out & to prove the recurrence. Even LC has just only explained for k=2.

An iterative based on the recurrence is also provided.

Theorem for general Josephus problem
Let j(n,k,i) denote the ith number should be removed. Then the following recurrence holds
j(n,k,i+1)≡(k+j(n−1,k,i))(modn)
where the initial value j(n,k,1)=(k−1)(modn)

Note f(n,k)=j(n,k,n) in Theorem

′
  is used, when j(n,k,i+1)≡0 then j(n,k,i+1)=n.
