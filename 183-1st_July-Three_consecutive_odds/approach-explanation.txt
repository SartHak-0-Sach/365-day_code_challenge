Approach
Given an integer array arr, return true if there are three consecutive odd numbers in the array. Otherwise, return false.

Use len to count the the length for consecutive odd numbers
If x in nums is even reset len=0, otherwise len++
if len==3 return true
When the loop is through, there are no three consecutive odds, return false
2nd C++ uses std::find_if with lambda which return the index if the first odd from index=i on is found in arr
i=find_if(arr.begin()+i, arr.end(), 
[](int x){return (x&1);})-arr.begin();
