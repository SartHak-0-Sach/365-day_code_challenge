Intuition
change folder problem, go deeper or go backward in a tree structure.

2nd approach uses the recursion, C & C++ codes are implemented in different ways.

3rd approach is to try a branchless loop suggested by @Sergei.

Approach
Set level=0 for the root.
Use a loop to transverse. If dir=="../" level-=(level>0) , else if dir!="./" level++
level is the answer
Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n)

Space complexity:
