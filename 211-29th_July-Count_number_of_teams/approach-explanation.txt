Intuition
Since we can use the same soldier for multiple teams, we just need to find number of ratings less than index i , mumber of ratings greater than index i which are on the left side of the index i and similarly umber of ratings less than index i , mumber of ratings greater than index i which are on the right side of the index i, multiply and add it to the answer.

Approach
Iterate over the array.
For every index i calculate the following:
lowerThanLeft
higherThanLeft
lowerThanRight
higherThanRight
Multiply lowerThanLeft and higherThanRight, similarly multiply higherThanLeft and lowerThanRight and add it to answer.
