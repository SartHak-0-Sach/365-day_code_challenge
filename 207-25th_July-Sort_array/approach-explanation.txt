Approach:
Base Case Handling:

If the array is null or has only one element, it's already sorted. Return the array as is.
Merge Sort Function:

Recursively divide the array into two halves until each subarray has one element.
Merge the subarrays back together in sorted order.
Merge Function:

Merge two sorted subarrays into a single sorted array.
Use temporary arrays to hold the elements of the subarrays during merging.
